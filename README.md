# Blurgs assigment (Student database with CRUD operations)

sorry but I coudn't figure out how to run on other system or gobally rather than my system (local host)Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
where should i buy a domian name etc...the backend part works well where all the CRUD operation, 
performs well i tested all of the in POSTMEN, as well as django framework locally the frontend part.
is what iam not sure cuase i'm still learning, i used PYCHARM for envornment npm with react for frntend, django with pyhton for backend.
